# Md. Abdul Mutalib

<!-- **Aspiring AI Researcher | Deep Learning & Machine Learning Specialist | Research Assistant at CRC Research Centre** -->

Welcome to my personal website! I am Md. Abdul Mutalib, a passionate researcher and software engineer with a deep interest in **Artificial Intelligence**, specifically focusing on **deep learning** applications in **medical diagnosis**. My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from [North East University Bangladesh (NEUB)](https://www.neub.edu.bd/), and I am currently involved in cutting-edge research at the **CRC Research Centre** on the project titled *"Hand Gesture Recognition and Visual Estimations."*

## Areas of Expertise
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Specializing in the development and implementation of algorithms for medical diagnostics, including pneumonia detection and eye disease identification using X-ray and retinal images.
- **Python Programming:** Proficient in building AI models using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
- **Research & Innovation:** Actively working on research projects and exploring innovative solutions in medical AI.

## Current Roles
- **Research Assistant** at CRC Research Centre, focusing on gesture recognition and visual estimation techniques.
- **Aspire Leadership Fellow** at [Aspire Institute](https://aspireleaders.org/), working towards leadership development and social impact in underrepresented communities.
- **Student Mentor & Instructor:** Teaching **Bangla** and **ICT** to over 230 students, focusing on Bangla literature and computer science.

## Ongoing Research
I am currently leading research on the following topics:
- **Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning:** Enhancing diagnostic accuracy through machine learning models applied to chest X-ray data.
- **Retinal Disease Classification:** Exploring the use of **ensemble learning techniques** for better detection of retinal diseases.
- **Transfer Learning in Medical Imaging:** Optimizing pre-trained models for specific diagnostic tasks.

## Academic Achievements
- **Thesis Project:** *Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning to Identify Pneumonia from Chest X-ray Images* (2024)
<!-- - **IELTS:** Scored **6.5 overall**, with a focus on improving my reading and speaking skills. -->
